## Abstract

Obsidian Systems proposes a Daml 3 Training Modernization Program to replace outdated Daml 2 training content with comprehensive, role-based learning paths for the Canton Network. The program delivers 24 new modules, ~10 updated modules, 12 live coding videos, capstone projects, and certification exams across five developer tracks: from beginner to solution architect, a Daml 2→3 certification bridge for experienced developers, and a new Canton Network overview path for developers coming from public chain ecosystems. Existing Daml 2 training materials reference removed APIs, deprecated tooling, and patterns incompatible with Daml 3, and contain no coverage of the public nature of the Canton Network (validators, SVs, Canton Foundation, tokenomics). This makes the current curriculum a critical gap for both developer onboarding and ecosystem growth. All content will be deployed to the existing LMS where Daml 2 training currently resides; Obsidian is not providing an LMS and will need access to the existing platform for content deployment. Content will be packaged in interoperable e-learning standards (SCORM, xAPI, or AICC) so that future SDK upgrades can be addressed through incremental content updates rather than a complete rewrite of the training program. Each milestone includes a structured quality gate with beta testing by external developers to validate content adoption before final acceptance.

---

## Specification

### 1. Objective

Current Daml training materials are built for Daml 2 and reference APIs, libraries, and tooling that no longer exist in Daml 3, including JSON API v1, @daml/ledger, @daml/react, the daml CLI, and controller-first syntax. Developers attempting to learn Daml or migrate existing applications encounter broken examples, missing documentation for core Daml 3 capabilities (Smart Contract Upgrades, Participant Query Store, multi-synchronizer architecture), and no structured path from onboarding through certification. Additionally, existing materials contain no coverage of the Canton Network from the perspective of developers coming from public chain ecosystems — there is no orientation to validators, super validators, the Canton Foundation, tokenomics, or the fundamental architectural differences between Canton and permissionless blockchains.

This program produces a complete, role-based training curriculum covering first-time Daml developers through solution architects, with all content validated against the current Daml 3.x SDK. Content will be packaged using interoperable e-learning standards (SCORM, xAPI, or AICC) and deployed to the existing LMS where Daml 2 training currently resides, ensuring future SDK upgrades can be accommodated through modular content updates rather than a full curriculum rewrite. Obsidian will require access to the existing LMS platform for content deployment and testing.

**Material Components Per Module**

- *Instructional Content:* Written course content with learning objectives; concept explanations with diagrams and illustrations; step-by-step tutorials with annotated code; quick reference cards for key concepts and commands.
- *Code Resources:* Working code examples tested against current Daml 3.x SDK; starter project templates; hands-on exercise repositories with solutions; integration examples (TypeScript, Java).
- *Assessment Materials:* Knowledge check questions (5–10 per module); hands-on exercises with acceptance criteria; module completion criteria.
- *Supporting Materials:* Troubleshooting guides for common issues; links to official documentation; glossary of terms.

**Quality Gate Process (Milestones 1–3)**

Each written-content milestone follows a three-stage quality gate process to ensure content quality and adoption readiness before final acceptance:

| Stage | Duration | Activity | Responsible |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| (a) Content Delivery + Docs Review | Per milestone schedule | Obsidian delivers all modules, code repos, exercises; Documentation Consistency Report produced concurrently during development | Obsidian |
| (b) Beta Feedback + Revision | ~1 week | 5 developers from 2+ organizations work through modules and provide structured feedback; Obsidian implements revisions in parallel; revision log published | DA/Canton Foundation (recruitment), Obsidian (coordination + revisions) |
| (c) Completion Verification | ~1 week | 5–10 developers complete modules end-to-end; Quality Gate Report confirms adoption readiness | DA/Canton Foundation (participants), Obsidian (reporting) |

**Feedback SLA:** A 2-week window applies to each beta feedback stage. If fewer than 3 of 5 beta testers respond within the window, the milestone proceeds to the revision stage based on available feedback to avoid project delays.

**Documentation Consistency Reviews (Milestones 1–3)**

As part of each written-content milestone, Obsidian will cross-reference all delivered modules against docs.canton.network during the content development process and deliver a Documentation Consistency Report alongside the module content. Each report covers: (a) which docs sources are consistent with the training content, (b) any documentation missing that would support the training material, and (c) any issues, errors, or inconsistencies found in the existing documentation. These reports serve as a feedback loop between the training program and the Canton documentation team.

**Capstone Projects**

| Capstone | Associated Path | Description |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Foundations Capstone | Path A | Simple multi-party application with testing |
| Developer Capstone | Path B | Production-ready application with SCU and API integration |
| Architect Capstone | Path C | Multi-synchronizer solution design and documentation |
| Canton Network Capstone | Path E | Design a Canton application that leverages privacy and multi-synchronizer capabilities, with a comparison document contrasting the approach on a public chain |

**Certification Exam Content**

| Exam | Question Types |
|------|---------------|
| Daml 3 Foundations | Multiple choice, code analysis |
| Daml 3 Application Developer | Multiple choice, code analysis, scenario-based |
| Daml 3 Solution Architect | Multiple choice, scenario-based, design analysis |
| Daml 2→3 Certification Bridge | Multiple choice, code analysis, migration scenario-based |
| Canton Network Fundamentals | Multiple choice, concept mapping, scenario-based |

**Content Gap Analysis**

*Content Requiring Replacement:*

| Obsolete Topic | Reason | Replacement |
|----------------|--------|-------------|
| JSON API v1 tutorials | Removed in Daml 3.4 | JSON API v2 content |
| @daml/ledger usage | Library removed | New integration patterns |
| @daml/react tutorials | Library removed | Alternative approaches |
| daml start with hot reload | Incompatible with SCU | dpm-based workflows |
| daml package / daml merge-dars | Commands removed | Updated build patterns |
| Query-by-attribute examples | Not supported in API v2 | PQS-based querying |

*New Content Required:*

| Topic | Justification |
|-------|---------------|
| Smart Contract Upgrades (SCU) | Core Daml 3 capability; no existing coverage |
| JSON Ledger API v2 | Mandatory for all integrations; replaces v1 |
| Digital Asset Package Manager (dpm) | Required tooling for Daml 3.4+ |
| Participant Query Store (PQS) | Replaces deprecated query patterns |
| Multi-Synchronizer Applications | Key Canton Network capability |
| Canton Network Integration | Production network deployment |
| External Signing Updates | New security model (V2 hashing) |
| Canton Network Architecture Overview | No existing coverage of public network nature for developers from other ecosystems |
| Network Roles, Governance & Tokenomics | Validators, SVs, Canton Foundation, Canton Coin not covered in Daml 2 materials |
| Public Chain to Canton Developer Guide | No onboarding path for Ethereum/Solana developers entering the Canton ecosystem |

**Existing Content Updates**

| Update Category | Scope |
|----------------|-------|
| Code Example Replacement | Remove all deprecated patterns (JSON API v1, @daml/ledger, controller-first syntax) |
| Terminology Updates | Update domain→synchronizer, application_id→user_id throughout |
| Tooling References | Replace daml CLI references with dpm |
| API Documentation | Update all Ledger API references to v2 |

Where structural elements of the existing training library remain applicable — course architecture, learning objective frameworks, and assessment design patterns — Obsidian will incorporate them rather than rebuild from scratch. The module content itself (code examples, API references, tooling walkthroughs, and technical explanations) must be replaced in full, because the APIs and tooling the existing training teaches have been removed or superseded in Daml 3. The structure informs what we build; the content cannot be reused.

**Phased Delivery (34 weeks)**

| Phase | Weeks | Modules Delivered | Outcome |
|-------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| 1: Critical Migration Content | 1–8 | What's Changed, New Capabilities, API Migration, Dev Workflow, Development Environment, Basic Ledger Integration, JSON API v2 Deep Dive + existing content updates + quality gate + docs review | Teams can begin Daml 3 development and migration; Daml 2 certified developers can begin leveling up |
| 2: Core Development Paths + Canton Network Intro | 9–19 | Functional Programming in Daml, Templates & Choices, Testing in Daml 3, Advanced Daml Patterns, Smart Contract Upgrades, Participant Query Store, Triggers & Automation, Application Testing & Quality, Canton Network Architecture, Network Roles & Governance, Tokenomics & Canton Coin + Foundations capstone + quality gate + docs review | Foundations and Application Developer paths complete; Canton Network path begins |
| 3: Advanced Architecture, Canton Network & Certification | 20–27 | Multi-Synchronizer Architecture, Canton Network Integration, Security & External Signing, Non-Functional Requirements, Migration & Upgrade Strategy, Public Chain to Canton Concepts, Privacy Compliance & Enterprise Design + remaining capstones + certification exams + quality gate + docs review | Full written training program operational across all 5 paths |
| 4: Live Code Engineering Media | 26–34 | 12 narrated videos (~4.25 hrs) covering Paths A and D (priority) | Priority video content delivered; Paths B, C, E, and remaining D videos available as future add-on |

**Content Formats**

| Deliverable Type | Format |
|------------------|--------|
| Written materials | Markdown and HTML, packaged for LMS import via SCORM, xAPI, or AICC |
| Code examples | Git repositories, tested against current stable Daml 3.x SDK |
| Videos | Edited files with companion repos (timestamp-tagged), transcripts, chapter markers, and metadata |

**Deliverables Summary**

| Category | Deliverable | Quantity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Course Design | Training path definitions | 5 |
| Course Design | Role mapping documentation | 1 |
| Course Design | Competency frameworks | 5 |
| New Modules | Complete module packages | 24 |
| Updated Modules | Revised existing modules | ~10 |
| Code Resources | Exercise/example repositories | 24+ |
| Capstone Projects | Project specifications | 4 |
| Certification | Exam question banks | 5 |
| Migration/Bridge Guides | Daml 2→3 certification bridge documentation | 4 |

| Quality Gate Reports | Beta feedback summaries and revision logs per milestone | 3 |

### 3. Architectural Alignment

The curriculum is structured around Daml 3 and Canton Network architecture:

- **Daml 3 language and tooling:** Modules cover the dpm package manager, Daml Script, the JSON Ledger API v2, and Smart Contract Upgrades, which are the core primitives for Daml 3 development.
- **Canton Network topology:** The Solution Architect path (S1–S5) teaches multi-synchronizer architecture, validator participation, Canton Coin integration, and external signing with HSM, directly supporting network decentralization and participation. The new Canton Network for Public Chain Developers path (N1–N5) provides a dedicated onboarding experience for developers coming from public chain ecosystems, covering network roles, governance, tokenomics, and the architectural differences that distinguish Canton from permissionless blockchains.
- **Participant Query Store (PQS):** Dedicated module (A4) covers the replacement for deprecated query-by-attribute patterns, aligning with the Canton team's architectural direction for off-ledger querying.
- **CIP-0082 alignment:** The Development Fund was established to support developer tools and shared infrastructure. A training program that lowers the barrier to building on Canton falls squarely within this scope.

### 4. Backward Compatibility

The program handles backward compatibility through the Daml 2→3 Certification Bridge path (Path D), which provides a focused delta course for Daml 2 certified developers covering what's changed, new Daml 3 capabilities, API migration patterns, and updated development workflows. This allows experienced developers to level up to Daml 3 certification without repeating foundational content, while also giving teams the knowledge needed to migrate existing applications.

No impact on existing Canton Network systems or integrations. The program produces educational content only.

## Motivation

Canton Network adoption depends on developers being able to learn Daml 3 and build applications effectively and grow the Canton Network as a whole. Today, the primary training materials are broken, referencing removed APIs, deprecated tools, and patterns that no longer work. Additionally, there is no onboarding path for developers coming from public chain ecosystems — the existing materials assume familiarity with Canton's architecture and provide no orientation to validators, super validators, the Canton Foundation, tokenomics, or the fundamental design differences between Canton and permissionless blockchains. This creates a compounding problem: new developers bounce off outdated content, public chain developers have no entry point, existing teams delay migration, and the ecosystem's growth is bottlenecked by a skills gap rather than a technology gap. Daml proficiency is the biggest limiting factor for increasing network participation.

A complete, role-based training program is shared infrastructure in the same way that SDKs and documentation are. It benefits every participant in the network (validators, app developers, solution architects, and the organizations that employ them) by reducing the time and cost of building on Canton.

---

## Rationale

**Why a new Daml 3 training course rather than updating the existing Daml 2 course?** The Daml 2→3 transition is not an incremental version bump; it is an architectural shift that changes the development model at every layer. The JSON API v1 that the entire Daml 2 integration curriculum is built around has been removed and replaced with v2, which has a fundamentally different endpoint structure, authentication model, and query approach. The @daml/ledger and @daml/react libraries that Daml 2 courses teach as the primary integration method no longer exist. The daml CLI that underpins every Daml 2 lab exercise has been replaced by dpm, which uses a different project structure, build workflow, and package management model. Core Daml 3 capabilities like Smart Contract Upgrades, the Participant Query Store, and multi-synchronizer architecture have no Daml 2 equivalent at all, meaning there is no existing module to "update" — these require entirely new instructional content, code examples, exercises, and assessments. In practice, attempting to update the Daml 2 course in-place would mean replacing every code example, rewriting every tutorial, rebuilding every exercise repository, and inserting entirely new modules for concepts that didn't previously exist, while simultaneously removing all references to tooling and APIs that have been deleted. The result would be a complete rewrite wearing the skin of an update, with the added risk of residual Daml 2 artifacts confusing learners. Building the Daml 3 curriculum as a new course ensures clean, internally consistent content from the ground up, avoids legacy contamination, and allows the Daml 2 course to remain available as a reference for teams that have not yet migrated.

**Why a structured curriculum rather than updated docs?** Documentation tells developers what exists; training teaches them how to use it. The gap in the Canton ecosystem is not missing reference pages but missing learning paths: sequenced, hands-on, role-appropriate content that takes a developer from zero to production. Updating docs alone would leave developers to assemble their own learning path from scattered sources.

**Why role-based paths?** Different roles need different content at different depths. A new developer needs foundations and simple exercises. An architect needs multi-synchronizer topology and security integration. A developer who already holds Daml 2 certifications needs a focused delta course covering only what's new and changed in Daml 3, without repeating the 40+ hours of foundational content they've already mastered. A developer coming from Ethereum or Solana needs an orientation to Canton's fundamentally different architecture — validators, SVs, tokenomics, privacy model — before the Daml-specific content makes sense. Five distinct paths serve these audiences without forcing anyone through irrelevant material.

**Why include video?** Written content works well for reference and self-paced learning, but live coding demonstrations show real development workflows (debugging, tooling usage, and decision-making) that are difficult to convey in text. The 22 videos cover the highest-priority paths (Foundations, Application Developer priority modules, and Certification Bridge) and supplement rather than replace written modules, giving developers a second way to absorb the material. Remaining Path C and Path B videos can be added as a future engagement without rework, since all written content and code repositories will already be complete.

**Why Obsidian Systems?** Obsidian is the leading Daml development firm on Canton Network. Ryan Trinkle, Obsidian's co-founder, sits on the Canton Foundation board. Obsidian holds active seats on five Canton Network governance committees and built Tradecraft, one of the first production applications on Canton mainnet. The team has led the most complex, highest-stakes Daml deployments on the network, including bringing the world's largest clearing house onto Canton and has direct, hands-on experience with the Daml 2→3 transition in production environments. That experience is what makes the technical conclusions in this proposal reliable. Content development can begin immediately, without a ramp-up period.

## Assumptions

- Digital Asset subject matter experts will be available for technical review; Obsidian will streamline review cycles to minimize the time commitment, targeting 2–4 hours per week with flexibility for heavier review during milestone acceptance windows. This time investment is reflected in the proposed 10% coin payment allocation to Digital Asset in recognition of their ongoing subject matter contribution across the 34-week program
- The DA/Canton Foundation will recruit and provide 5 beta testers from at least 2 different organizations for each quality gate cycle (Milestones 1–3). Obsidian will coordinate logistics, distribute materials, and collect feedback. A 2-week feedback window applies per cycle; if fewer than 3 of 5 responses are received within the window, the milestone proceeds to the revision stage based on available feedback to prevent project stalls
- The DA/Canton Foundation will similarly facilitate access to 5–10 developers for the completion verification stage of each quality gate cycle
- Training materials will be delivered in Markdown and HTML formats, packaged for import into the existing LMS (where Daml 2 content currently resides) using SCORM, xAPI, or AICC standards to ensure future upgradability
- Obsidian will require access to the existing LMS platform for content deployment and testing
- All code examples will target the current stable Daml 3.x SDK release at time of development
- Certification exam question development is in scope; exam platform configuration is not
- Obsidian will have access to Daml 3 SDK and development environments for testing
- Videos will be recorded by Obsidian engineers; talent provided by Obsidian
- Basic editing included (cuts, transitions, lower-thirds); motion graphics/animation not included
- One round of revisions included per video based on feedback
- Branding assets (logos, intro/outro templates) will be provided by the Canton Foundation if applicable
- Videos are delivered as files; LMS embedding/configuration is the Foundation's responsibility

## Out of Scope

- LMS platform provisioning, administration, or configuration (Obsidian requires access to the existing LMS for content deployment only)
- Recruitment of beta testers and completion verification participants for quality gate cycles (DA/Canton Foundation responsibility)
- Certification exam proctoring setup
- Instructor-led training delivery
- Translation or localization
- Ongoing content maintenance post-delivery
- Marketing materials for training programs
- Remediation of issues found in docs.canton.network documentation (Obsidian will identify and report issues; fixes are the documentation team's responsibility)
