## Abstract

Avro Digital requests 2,500,000 Canton Coin (CC) to design, implement, and prepare for rollout a standalone SV governance dApp that separates non-operational governance voting from node operations on the Global Synchronizer.

Today, the governance experience is embedded in the Splice SV application and tied to the same identity path used for node automation. This project extracts that workflow into a dedicated dApp, introduces the minimal Daml/CIP changes needed for a separate governance-voting identity for non-operational votes, proves external signing through the Canton wallet stack, and packages the result for SV-operated deployment alongside existing SV node infrastructure within the **current one-vote-per-node model**.

This proposal is intentionally narrow. It does **not** attempt to redesign governance, expand direct on-chain voting to a broader stakeholder set, or introduce a general-purpose external identity platform. Its purpose is to deliver the technical separation and operator-ready UX needed for future governance evolution.

### Scope amendment (M1 clarification)

Following ecosystem review, Milestone 1 should explicitly cover more than a vote-type allowlist. The contract/CIP work includes splitting DSO rules config and Amulet config so each classifiable field can be labeled **operational**, **governance**, or **fixed**, plus a governance vote process for changing those classifications over time.

The default classification is **governance**, not operational: unless a field is explicitly marked operational or fixed, the vote is cast by the governance-voter party. One-vote-per-SV semantics and the current voter set remain unchanged.

---

## Specification

### 1. Objective

Deliver a standalone governance dApp and supporting Daml changes that support separation of governance voting from node operations while preserving the current one-vote-per-node model.

The project includes:

- A standalone governance dApp derived from the existing SV governance flow
- Daml/CIP template infrastructure for operational/governance/fixed classification across DSO and Amulet config fields, with governance as the default classification
- External-signing support through the Canton wallet stack using CIP-103 compatibility
- Operator-administered governance-voter/key binding for the current SV workflow
- UX improvements that adapt the existing governance UI rather than rebuilding it from scratch

Explicit non-goals:

- Broader redesign of governance rights or governance process
- Direct on-chain voting by a wider stakeholder set
- Tokenomics changes
- Independent voter-hosted deployment
- A generalized external identity platform
- Long-tail UX work such as mobile apps, notification systems, or broader collaboration workflows

These should be treated as follow-on work, not as implied scope within this proposal.

### 2. Implementation Mechanics

The implementation is organized around four tightly scoped workstreams:

**Daml and CIP work**

The current `DsoRules` model assumes governance voting follows the operator identity path. This project introduces configurable vote-category infrastructure while preserving one-vote-per-SV semantics.

The Phase 1 on-chain model is:

- Each SV retains one vote
- DSO rules config and Amulet config fields can be classified as **operational**, **governance**, or **fixed**
- Governance is the default classification for unset fields, so classifiable config votes use the governance-voter path unless explicitly marked operational or fixed
- Operational fields remain operator-controlled; fixed fields cannot be reclassified through the classification vote process
- A governance vote process allows SVs to change field classifications over time where reclassification is permitted
- Action-level vote taxonomy remains related but distinct from field-level config classification; both are documented in the CIP

This is more than classifying vote types alone, so the CIP and contract package must make the expanded field-level scope explicit.

This requires a focused CIP and corresponding changes in `splice-dso-governance`.

**Standalone governance dApp**

The governance experience will move into a separate web application rather than remain embedded in the SV-only surface. The dApp will:

- Display pending proposals and vote history
- Make vote actions explicit and auditable
- Show the authority path used for each vote
- Support clearer review and confirmation workflows
- Reuse the existing governance UI wherever practical

The dApp must support both the read path and the write path. Phase 1 assumes proposal discovery and vote-state inspection through existing API surfaces such as Scan rather than broad public visibility of the underlying contracts.

**External signing**

Rather than building a custom wallet path, the project will use the existing Canton wallet stack:

- `@canton-network/dapp-sdk`
- Wallet Gateway
- A compatible signing-provider or wallet path

The target is **CIP-103-compatible external signing** for governance-voter parties whose confirming participant is not the SV node.

**Deployment model**

The initial rollout remains conservative:

- SV-operated, with the dApp UI and supporting services packaged to run alongside existing SV node infrastructure
- One vote per node
- Used by current SV operators and governance voters
- Packaged for staged rollout alongside the existing SV UI

The governance-voter party does not need to be hosted on the SV node.

The user model also stays intentionally narrow. Phase 1 assumes operator-administered binding between the approved governance voter and the key or wallet path used for governance voting; it does not introduce self-service registration or a generalized external voter registry.

### 3. Architectural Alignment

This proposal is aligned with current Canton and Splice architecture in four ways:

- It preserves the existing one-vote-per-node model while decoupling governance voting from node automation, which reduces operational coupling without forcing a broader governance redesign into the same project.
- It builds on the existing Splice governance stack and introduces a narrow, reviewable CIP plus targeted Daml changes rather than a disruptive contract rewrite.
- It uses the Canton wallet stack and targets CIP-103-compatible external signing instead of inventing a parallel signing system, which keeps the implementation aligned with the ecosystem's wallet direction.
- It contributes the output to the open-source Canton/Splice ecosystem under standard open-source licensing, making the work reusable for future governance evolution.

### 4. Backward Compatibility

Backward compatibility is a core design constraint for this project:

- The initial rollout preserves one-vote-per-node semantics and the current voter set.
- Operational fields retain today's operator path; governance-classified fields use the governance-voter path.
- Template infrastructure supports future classification changes without requiring a disruptive contract rewrite.
- The dApp is packaged for staged rollout alongside the existing SV UI rather than requiring a hard cutover.

## Co-Marketing

Upon release, Avro Digital will collaborate with the Canton Foundation on:

- Announcement coordination for milestone and release communications
- A case study or technical blog covering the governance architecture, wallet integration, and rollout approach
- Developer and ecosystem promotion tied to the new governance workflow

## Motivation

The near-term governance problem is that participation is still operationally coupled to running a node.

Today, a relatively small number of SV nodes represent a larger and growing set of funded organizations. That arrangement is still workable, but it places node operators in the middle of a governance workflow that should have a clearer and more dedicated path. The existing SV application is also not the right long-term place to iterate on governance-specific signing flows, authority boundaries, and user experience.

A focused technical step is available now: extract governance into a standalone dApp, separate non-operational governance voting from node operations, and prove standards-aligned external signing without taking on a broader redesign of governance rights or stakeholder representation in the same project.

This gives the ecosystem a cleaner technical foundation for future governance evolution while delivering immediate practical value to current SV operators and governance participants.

---

## Rationale

The key design choice is to separate governance from node operations without trying to solve every future governance question in the same grant. A standalone dApp gives governance review, signing, and audit flows their own surface, while the Phase 1 scope preserves one-vote-per-node semantics and keeps the CIP and implementation reviewable.

Using the Canton wallet stack and reusing the existing governance UI wherever practical both reduce delivery risk. The project can focus on the contract, signing, read-path, routing, and deployment changes that matter now instead of spending the grant on a bespoke wallet path or a full UI rewrite.

Avro Digital is proposing this as a focused, upstream-collaborative first step grounded in direct Scala, Daml, and production-infrastructure experience.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Defining vote and config-field classification is harder than expected | Medium | High | Make DSO/Amulet per-field classification and the reclassification vote process explicit in the CIP, with maintainer review of the initial field map |
| CIP/review cycle takes longer than planned | Medium | High | Keep the initial contract proposal narrow and start review early |
| Contract design changes during upstream review | Medium | Medium | Treat the current contract shape as representative, not fixed |
| Wallet interoperability is rough in the first implementation | Medium | Medium | Validate one concrete wallet/gateway path before broadening scope |
| Scope drifts toward full external stakeholder voting | High | High | Keep the project explicitly constrained to one vote per node |
| UI hosting and governance-voter party hosting get conflated | Medium | Medium | Keep SV-operated UI deployment in scope while separately allowing governance-voter confirmation through a different participant |
| Production rollout timing depends on external release windows | Medium | Medium | Make rollout readiness, not forced production timing, the milestone target |
