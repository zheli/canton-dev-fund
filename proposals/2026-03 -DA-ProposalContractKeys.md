# Executive Summary

This proposal is to reintroduce the contract key feature into the Canton Network technology stack. A *contract key* is a stable identifier that simplifies reasoning, programming with the UTXO contracts, and managing client integrations which are core to the Canton Network Global Synchronizer. Anecdotally, one organization estimated that the contract key feature decreased their dApp development by 30%. Current Canton Network application providers are asking about it. It is either blocking or slowing Canton 2.x applications from moving to the Canton Network. Since contract keys simplify the programming model, it will make it easier for developers to migrate their application from other blockchains. As a side effect, it can result in lower traffic costs by reducing the number of contracts used for bookkeeping in an application.

Adding back contract keys touches almost every piece of the Canton Network technology stack so this is a significant project. The estimated budget is 11,150,000 Canton Coins. The project can start immediately and extends over 12 months.

# Motivation

The UTXO model of Canton Network's Global Synchronizer imposes a bookkeeping burden on applications. Currently, every contract is tracked by an internal *contract ID* (an opaque, auto-generated identifier). Since contracts are immutable, a single field update to a contract results in a new contract being created with a brand new contract ID and the old contract is archived so the old contract ID is no longer useful. Yet, the Daml business logic, or its clients, need to track a contract as it evolves which means they must perform bookkeeping tasks each time a contract is updated,archived, and recreated. These bookkeeping tasks require additional Daml logic, backend logic, and integration logic.

This proposal reintroduces the contract key feature which was previously available in Daml 2.x.
A *contract key* is a stable identifier that simplifies reasoning and programming with the UTXO contracts that are core to the Canton Network Global Synchronizer. They relieve the bookkeeping burden of tracking contract IDs as the contract evolves: as a contract is updated, via archive and create operations, the currently active contract can easily be referenced via the contract key. The contract key feature simplifies both the Daml business logic developer as well as the client of that Daml business logic (e.g., backend service).

Contract keys will enable Ethereum or Solana developers to more easily develop applications on the Canton Network because the UTXO mental model is simplified. Services that integrate with the ledger will be simpler because they have a stable identifier to program with and that simplicity pays dividends. This implies that contract keys will make it easier to migrate a dApp from another blockchain to the Canton Network.

Contract keys have not yet been included in Canton 3.x because of the launch timelines and the complexity of extending the feature for a public multi-synchronizer network. It is a new feature so it can be introduced without concerns over backwards compatibility.

Following are some proof points of the benefit:

* Almost 100% of Daml 2.x applications used this feature.
* In a large 2.x Daml application, contract keys were attributed with reducing application development effort by 30% while resulting in more easily maintained code.
* Several Canton 2.x applications by investment banks use contract keys so extensively that they are actively requesting this feature to be made available to migrate to the Global Synchronizer.
* Canton Network application providers (e.g., Chainlink) have also expressed interest and requested access to contract keys even though the feature is not yet available.
* Data has shown that contract keys can indirectly reduce the transaction size because the contracts involved in the bookkeeping are overhead that is no longer needed. This can reduce traffic cost.

Once contract keys are available, it is expected that larger and more sophisticated applications can be developed faster because the additional complexity of contract ID bookkeeping is eliminated or greatly reduced.

# Specification

## Objective

Contract keys are similar in concept to primary or secondary keys in relational databases. Contract keys do not change and can be used to refer to a contract even when the contract ID changes. Technically, the contract key can be an arbitrary serializable expression that does not contain contract IDs.

Contract key support needs to be threaded through the entire CN application stack. Each affected component is briefly discussed next as background for the discussion of the scope and budget. The affected components are:

* Daml language and compiler
* Visual Studio Code IDE
* Canton Ledger gRPC and JSON API
* Daml engine
* Daml Script
* Participant Query Store and Daml Shell
* [Canton Network Application Quick Start](https://github.com/digital-asset/cn-quickstart)
* Documentation

Of course, other community developed tools can be enhanced to support contract keys but the components just listed are the canonical foundation for Canton Network so they need to be included in the feature's initial release.

A difference between this proposal and the Daml 2.x implementation is that this proposal allows a contract key to refer to zero, one, or several contracts at the same time; Daml 2.x only allows for zero or one contract to be referred to, as well as to test for non-existence of a contract key. In Canton 3.x, allowing a key to refer to one, zero, or several contracts does have the advantage that a contract key can act like a secondary key of a database.

Each affected component is discussed next.

### Daml Language and Compiler

The Daml language and compiler need to reintroduce two keywords: `key` and `maintainer`. To define a contract key in a Daml template, you use the `key` keyword and specify the `maintainer`.

* The `key` expression is a value that identifies the contract (always includes a `Party` for scoping).
* A `maintainer` is the party that validates all action on a key to guarantee their consistency. The central task of the `maintainer` is to verify the keys are retrieved in a consistent order within the transaction. A `maintainer` must be a signatory.

Here’s an example of setting up a contract key for a bank account, to act as a bank account ID:

```
type AccountKey = (Party, Text)

template Account with
   bank : Party
    number : Text
    owner : Party
    balance : Decimal
    observers : [Party]
    subaccount: optional AccountKey
  where
    signatory [bank, owner]
    observer observers

    key (bank, number) : AccountKey
    maintainer key._1
```

The Daml language and the Daml engine is enhanced to allow for the following new APIs:[^1]

* `fetchNByKey`: A client fetches up to N contract IDs with the same key
* `exerciseByKey`: It allows a client application to exercise a choice on an active contract by specifying its contract key instead of its opaque ContractID
* `queryNByKey`: returns a list of contract IDs, up to a given limit, using a contract key.  It has the ability to do an *exhaustive query* that returns all the known contracts that have the key.

All of these new endpoints will honor the privacy rules of Canton.

### Visual Studio Code IDE

The visual studio code IDE needs to be enhanced for:

* Incremental parsing that includes the new keywords.
* In context, auto-completion and auto-suggestion editing suggestions for contract key fields.
* Error message parsing and navigating for contract key messages.

These are table stakes capabilities.

### Canton Ledger gRPC and JSON API

The `Command` message in `CommandService` (Submit / SubmitAndWait) will be enhanced to allow you to exercise a choice on a contract identified only by its `key` — without knowing the current `ContractId`. The `Command` type `exerciseByKey` will be provided. The `EventQueryService` type `GetEventsByNContractKey`, (or similar name) for querying by key, will be added as well.

### Daml Engine

 The Canton runtime adapts to contract keys as follows:

* The Daml virtual machine needs to resolve contract keys to Contract IDs during the prepare step in a command submission and during confirmations.
* The transaction object returned by the prepare step needs to embed the referenced contract keys.

All of the privacy rules of Canton are respected.

### Daml Script

Daml Script is used for testing Daml logic. To support contract key use in testing, the Daml Script command `queryNByKey` will be added to the `stdlib` and handled in the daml-script runner. An `exerciseByKey` command will also be added.

### Participant Query Store and Daml Shell

The Participant Query Store (PQS) provides a SQL API to query the currently active contracts, as well as historical information. It needs to support querying using a contract key.

Daml Shell is a command line tool for navigating historical contract information and is extremely useful at scale for support purposes. It uses PQS as its data source so it also needs to support contract key query and navigation.

### Canton Network (CN) Application Quick Start

The CN Quick Start is the on ramp for new developers so it should highlight the use of contract keys. It will be restructured to make use of contract keys through the entire application stack.

### Documentation

New documentation and sample code is needed to support application development. This will be added.

### Additional Engineering Tasks

There are additional engineering tasks that are included in this plan that are cross cutting: adding documentation, performance optimization, an internal security audit, and an external security audit conducted by an independent, reputable Web3 security firm. The two primary aspects of the performance optimization are:

* The SQL to the participant node database layer to utilize batching;
* Implement a caching layer in the participant node for the most recent contracts that match a key.

Similar optimizations in the prior version of contract keys proved fruitful.

## Milestones, Deliverables, and Acceptance Criteria

To reiterate, contract key support is threaded through the entire CN application stack which involves the following components:

* Daml language and compiler
* Visual Studio Code IDE
* Canton Ledger gRPC and JSON API
* Daml engine
* Daml Script
* Participant Query Store and Daml Shell
* CN Quick Start
* Documentation

Additional actions are added for the performance optimization, internal security audit, and external security audit.
